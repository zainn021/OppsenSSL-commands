Objective:
To gain practical experience with OpenSSL commands for encrypting, decrypting using modern
cryptographic algorithms, managing certificates, generating hashes, and implementing secure
communication.
Scenario:
You are a Cyber Security Analyst at XYZ Corp, a medium-sized company specializing in e-commerce. As
part of your role, you are tasked with gaining hands-on experience with OpenSSL to enhance the
company's cyber security posture.
Assignment Components:
OpenSSL Practical Exercise
 Encrypt and Decrypt Files
o Use OpenSSL commands to encrypt and decrypt a file using AES-256 encryption.
o Document the OpenSSL commands used and provide a brief explanation of each step.
 Manage Certificates
o Generate a self-signed certificate and a certificate signing request (CSR) using OpenSSL.
o Sign the CSR with the self-signed certificate to create a CA-signed certificate.
o Document the OpenSSL commands used and provide a brief explanation of each step.
 Generate Hashes
o Generate and verify SHA-256 and MD5 hashes for a file using OpenSSL commands.
o Document the OpenSSL commands used and provide a brief explanation of each step.
 Implement Secure Communication
o Set up a secure TLS/SSL connection between a server and a client using OpenSSL.
o Document the OpenSSL commands used and provide a brief explanation of each step.
 Digital Signature and Verification
o Generate a digital signature for a file using OpenSSL commands.
o Verify the digital signature to ensure the file's integrity using OpenSSL commands.
o Document the OpenSSL commands used and provide a brief explanation of each step.
